# Product Requirements Document: Project Portal

Version: 0.3  
Current Date: April 9, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Project Portal is a next-generation desktop application designed to create a collaborative workspace where multiple AI agents and human team members can work together seamlessly on tasks and projects.  
**Core Philosophy:** We operate on the assumption that AI excels at specific, tool-like skills (e.g., programming, searching, drafting reports, recalling deterministic knowledge like facts, laws, technical details) with speed, breadth, and tireless endurance. Project Portal aims to harness this capability by assigning these well-defined, often laborious tasks (the "dirty work") to AI agents. This frees human users – the experts in their respective domains – to focus on their unique strengths: **creativity, strategic decision-making, nuanced communication with the real world (clients, patients, stakeholders), understanding implicit needs, providing critical context, guiding AI efforts, and correcting AI outputs.**  
The application aims to bring this powerful human-AI synergy into **real-world professional work scenarios**, revolutionizing workflows and empowering users to achieve more. Achieving these goals hinges on fostering significantly more effective **communication** and **collaboration**, not only between **human team members** but crucially between **humans and multiple, specialized AI agents** working in concert. Project Portal provides the environment where these complex interactions – **human-to-human, human-to-agent, and agent-to-agent** (as part of the coordinated multi-agent system) – can occur seamlessly within the context of shared tasks and projects.  
It is built upon a flexible framework where individual **Agents** are constituted by combining three key foundational elements: the underlying AI **Model** (e.g., a specific LLM), a set of accessible **Tools** (functions the agent can use), and a dedicated **Memory** system (for context and learning).

## 2. Goals & Objectives

* **Enhance Productivity & Capability:** Significantly increase the output, efficiency, and scope of work achievable by target users by integrating AI capabilities directly into their processes.  
* **Synergistic Human-AI Workflows:** Facilitate novel ways of working that strategically combine human insight, creativity, and decision-making with AI's speed, knowledge recall, and tool execution.  
* **Unified Collaboration:** Provide a single, integrated platform for managing tasks, projects, team members, and AI agents.  
* **Empower Domain Experts:** Give individuals and small teams capabilities previously only available to larger organizations, specifically tailored to professional domains.  
* **Accessibility for Non-Technical Experts:** Lower the barrier for highly skilled professionals (who are not necessarily technologists) to leverage advanced AI capabilities through an **intuitive and easy-to-understand interface**.  
* **Flexibility & Adaptability:** Create a robust platform that can mold to diverse professional workflows, acknowledging that different fields and individuals have unique processes and preferences.  
* **Personalized Environment (Longer Term):** Evolve towards an environment that learns from user interaction to suggest workflow improvements and personalize the experience.

## 3. Target Audience

While the application might be used by tech-savvy individuals, the primary target users are **highly competent professionals, experts, and leaders in their respective fields who are *not necessarily* specialized technologists.** They possess:

* **Deep Domain Expertise:** They are accomplished doctors, lawyers, researchers, analysts, consultants, executives, creatives, or other experts with rich experience and a clear understanding of their work.  
* **Strong Learning Ability & Flexibility:** They are intelligent, adaptable, and open to adopting new technologies and methods that offer a distinct advantage.  
* **Desire for Innovation:** They are motivated to leverage AI to fundamentally improve or even revolutionize their existing workflows and achieve higher levels of performance or insight.  
* **Need for Usability:** Because they are domain experts first and foremost, the software must be **easy to understand, intuitive to use, and require minimal technical overhead** to configure and operate effectively.

This audience includes:

* **Super Individuals:** High-performing solo practitioners or knowledge workers.  
* **Solo Companies / Solopreneurs:** Running lean businesses leveraging AI extensively.  
* **Elite Professional Teams (2-5 members):** Small, high-impact groups in fields like legal, medical, consulting, finance, research, or specialized creative work.

## 4. Key Features

* **Workspace Management:**  
  * **Personal Workspace:** Automatic creation for each user upon signup.  
  * **Team Workspaces:** Users can create, join, invite members to, and manage shared Team Workspaces (representing teams, companies, or collaborative groups).  
  * User roles and permissions within Team Workspaces (e.g., Admin, Member).  
* **Project Management:**  
  * Create, manage, and organize Projects within Workspaces (Personal or Team).  
  * Assign members (human and AI) to specific projects.  
* **Collaboration & Communication:**  
  * **Chat:** Real-time chat functionality within Projects, supporting:  
    * Direct Messages (1-to-1, human-human or human-agent).  
    * Group Chats involving multiple humans and/or AI agents.  
  * **Conversational Workspace:** The primary interaction model within chats, integrating communication, agent actions, and tool usage.  
  * **Integrated Interactive Tools:** Ability to seamlessly launch and utilize collaborative tools (e.g., shared whiteboards, data visualization dashboards, document editors) directly within the conversational context. Both humans and AI agents can interact with and contribute to these tools.  
* **AI Agent Framework:** Manages the configuration, interaction, and lifecycle of AI Agents. Each Agent is defined by its Model, Tools, and Memory.  
  * **Agent Management:**  
    * Define, configure (via NL and GUI), deploy, and monitor specialized AI agents.  
    * **Agent Scoping:** Assign agents to operate within specific scopes: Personal Workspace, Team Workspace, or individual Projects.  
    * **Agent Roles:** Configure agents for specific roles (e.g., Project Manager, Workspace Administrator, Domain Expert).  
    * **Agent Mobility & Persistence:** Agents can be moved or copied between scopes (e.g., promoting a personal agent to a Team Workspace, assigning an experienced agent to a new project). **Crucially, only the Agent's Memory travels; Tools require explicit re-configuration and authorization in the new scope.**  
    * *(Potential Feature)* Agent Discovery: Workspace Admin agents might assist in identifying or recommending suitable existing agents for new tasks or projects based on their memory/capabilities.  
  * **Tool Integration:**  
    * Define, manage, and provide tools accessible to agents (and potentially humans) (e.g., code execution including interactive web page generation, web Browse, API access, file I/O, data analysis/visualization).  
    * **Contextual Tool Configuration & Authorization:** Tools (especially those involving credentials or sensitive actions) are configured and authorized *per scope* (e.g., within a specific Team Workspace or Project) and are **not** automatically inherited when an agent is moved or copied. This is a key security measure.  
  * **Memory System:**  
    * Configure and manage the memory components for agents.  
    * Leverages the detailed **Memory Architecture** (see Section 6). Includes distinctions like Short-Term vs. Long-Term memory.  
* **Knowledge Management:**  
  * Define, populate, and manage shared **Workspace Knowledge Bases** and **Project Knowledge Bases** (see Section 6).  
  * Provide interfaces for users to view and potentially contribute to these knowledge bases.  
* **Asset Management:**  
  * Automatic capture, organization, and review of assets (documents, code, visualizations, reports, whiteboard sessions) generated during collaboration.  
  * Centralized Asset Hub linked to originating context (chat/task).  
  * *(Future Feature)* **Asset Sharing:** Implement mechanisms to easily share specific generated assets externally.  
* **Workflow Adaptability:** Allow for customization of workflows and agent configurations to suit different project types and user preferences.  
* **Desktop Application:**  
  * Cross-platform availability (Windows, macOS, Linux) leveraging Tauri.  
  * Native desktop experience with potential for offline capabilities or local data processing.  
* **(Future Goal) Memory Auditing & Editing:**

  * Allow authorized users to review, audit, and potentially modify/correct an agent's learned knowledge (Long-Term Memory).  
* **(Future Goal) Workflow Learning & Personalization:** System passively learns from interactions (task assignments, feedback, corrections) to suggest optimizations or tailor agent behavior over time.  
* **(Future Goal) User-Defined Agents & Tools:**  
  * Provide capabilities for users to visually design or configure custom agents, including defining their prompts, selecting existing tools, and potentially creating or integrating new custom tools (representing extensible agent capabilities beyond pre-defined options).  
* **(Future Goal) Agent Performance Evaluation & Management:**  
  * Implement mechanisms for users to monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback on agent performance, reliability, and adherence to instructions over time, similar to performance management for human team members. This could include metrics, review workflows, or explicit feedback loops integrated into the agent's learning process.

## 5. Workspace, Project, and Collaboration Model

This application organizes work into distinct scopes:

* **5.1 Personal Workspace:**  
  * A private, default space for every user.  
  * Used for individual task management, experimentation with agents, and personal knowledge development.  
  * Agents and projects created here are private by default.  
* **5.2 Team Workspaces:**  
  * Shared environments created by users to represent a team, company, or specific collaboration group.  
  * Users can be invited and assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Member).  
  * Contains shared Projects, Agents, and a Workspace-level Knowledge Base.  
  * Facilitates multi-user and multi-agent collaboration on shared objectives.  
* **5.3 Projects:**  
  * Units of work housed *within* either a Personal or Team Workspace.  
  * Used to organize tasks, chats, assets, and participants (human and AI) related to a specific goal or initiative.  
  * Can have its own dedicated Project-level Knowledge Base.  
* **5.4 Chats:**  
  * The primary communication interface within Projects.  
  * Can be 1-to-1 (Human-Human, Human-Agent) or Group chats (multiple Humans and/or Agents).  
  * Serves as the context for conversation, task execution, tool use, and asset generation.

## 6. Memory Architecture

Effective context and learning are enabled by a multi-layered memory system:

* **6.1 Agent Memory:** Persistent memory attached to an individual agent instance. It travels with the agent if moved or copied. Comprises:  
  * **6.1.1 Short-Term Memory (Working Context):** Holds information directly relevant to the current ongoing task, conversation, or operation (e.g., recent messages, intermediate results). Usually has a limited size or time window. Cleared or archived frequently.  
  * **6.1.2 Long-Term Memory (Learned Knowledge):** Stores generalized knowledge, skills, procedures, and experiences accumulated by the agent over time through interactions and task completion. This is the "experience" that makes an agent valuable when moved to new projects (e.g., general project management skills learned by a PM agent). This is the target for future Memory Auditing.  
* **6.2 Project Knowledge Base (Project Memory):**  
  * A repository of information specific to a particular Project (e.g., project brief, key decisions, relevant files, technical specs).  
  * Accessible by all human and AI members participating in that Project.  
  * Provides shared context relevant only to that specific Project.  
* **6.3 Workspace Knowledge Base (Workspace Memory):**  
  * A repository of information relevant to the entire Team Workspace (e.g., company policies, team members' skills, standard operating procedures, shared templates).  
  * Accessible by all human and AI members within that Workspace.  
  * Provides broader shared context for all projects within the workspace.  
* **6.4 Contextual Synergy:** During operation, an agent typically utilizes a combination of its own Agent Memory (Short-Term + Long-Term) along with relevant information fetched from the active Project and Workspace Knowledge Bases to inform its responses and actions, ensuring highly contextualized behavior.

## 7. Technical Stack

* **Framework:** Tauri (Rust backend, Webview frontend)  
* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
* **Backend / Core Logic:** Rust  
* **Client-side Scripting/Agents:** Pyodide (for running Python-based agents/tools within the frontend sandbox)

## 8. Design & UX Considerations

* **Simplicity & Intuitiveness:** Paramount importance due to the non-technical expert target audience. Leverage familiar paradigms like group chat. Manage complexity of Workspaces, Projects, Agents, Memory layers, and Tool configurations clearly.  
* **Seamless Tool Integration:** Interactive tools (whiteboards, charts) should feel like embedded components of the workspace, not separate applications, allowing fluid interaction by both humans and AI within the conversational flow.  
* **Transparency & Control:** Users need visibility into agent actions and reasoning, plus easy ways to guide, correct, and configure both via NL and structured UIs. Provide clarity on which memory/knowledge sources an agent is using. Make Tool authorization explicit and clear.  
* **Asset Visibility & Organization:** Make it effortless for users to find, understand the context of, and manage the various assets (code, reports, visualizations) generated during their work. Easy navigation between Chats, Projects, Workspaces, and associated Assets/Knowledge Bases.  
* **Clear Visualization:** Provide clear feedback on agent status, actions, thought processes (if possible), and collaboration flow. Visualize agent roles, scopes, and memory interactions if possible.  
* **Minimal Friction:** Focus on streamlining the core loop: discuss -> assign -> execute (human/AI) -> generate asset -> review -> iterate. Streamline common actions like creating projects, adding agents, managing permissions.

## 9. Security & Privacy Considerations

* **9.1 Agent Mobility Security Model:**  
  * Re-emphasize: When agents are moved/copied between scopes (especially Personal to Team), **only Memory is transferred**.  
  * **Tool Re-Authorization is Mandatory:** Sensitive tools requiring credentials or specific permissions **must** be explicitly re-configured and authorized by an appropriate user (e.g., Workspace Admin, Project Lead) within the destination scope. This prevents accidental leakage of personal credentials or unauthorized actions in a shared environment.  
* **9.2 Knowledge Base Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for viewing and modifying Workspace and Project Knowledge Bases. Ensure users/agents only access information appropriate for their role and project membership.  
* **9.3 Data Privacy:**  
  * Clearly define data storage policies (local vs. cloud options).  
  * Address privacy concerns related to potentially sensitive information in chats, knowledge bases, and agent memories.  
  * Consider encryption at rest and in transit.  
* **9.4 Memory Auditing Implications:** While providing transparency, ensure that memory auditing features respect user privacy and potentially sensitive information contained within an agent's memory. Define who can audit which agent's memory.
